      <h2 class="section-title">Take the First Step Toward Meaningful Change</h2>
      <p>Life often feels like you are surviving as an outsider rather than living within a community. Perhaps this has left you with a harsh inner critic that protects you from harm by keeping you isolated. This protection can leave us feeling empty inside, constantly exhausted, and fed up with life. The gap between the life you have and the life you want feels larger every day. You feel like you've tried everything, but you have been unable to meet your goals. </p></br>
      <p>This frustration is actually a call to action.  A sign that you're ready for change, even if the first steps aren't clear. In therapy, we can explore those steps together, clarify your goals, and build the skills to reach them. Whether you want to quiet your inner critic, reconnect with your strengths, rebuild relationships, or cultivate self-compassion, you can become an empowered agent of change in your own life.</p></br>

    <p>Therapy is a personal journey, and trusting your therapist is essential. Many people feel therapy “didn't work,” when the real issue was not having the right fit with their practitioner. This free consultation gives you a risk-free chance to meet your therapist and see if he's the right match for you.</p>
